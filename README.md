# Rubik-Cube-Solver
This should be a Rubik Cube which solves itself, but I'm still working on it.
Made using Unity engine. The main script is located to `Assets/MainScript.cs`. If you are good with C# and Unity language, you can help me with this project.

I am currently working on: <ins>Solving the cube</ins>.

_**Do you want to try my game? I do have one release! Go to https://github.com/ezluci/Rubik-Cube-Solver/releases.**_ The main script is put in `Main Camera` object! You can read the colors on the cube after every move. It's updating using the MoveChildsAndRearrangeColors(string Move) function.
