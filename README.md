# Rubik-Cube-Solver
This should be a Rubik Cube which solves itself.
This application is made using Unity. It is still under construction, tho. If you are good with C# and Unity language, you can help me with this project.
First, install Github Desktop and create a clone to this repository to your computer. Then open Unity and... code. Save everything, go to Github Desktop and "commit to master".

I made the moves first. Next, I need to make the user-interaction, meaning the user can move the cube.
For any issues, go to Issues tab and tell me.
